Ques 1. What are the assumptions of linear regression?

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
It also assumes homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors)
no multicollinearity among predictors
Normality: Residuals follow a normal distribution.
No multicollinearity: Predictors aren’t highly correlated with each other.


Ques 2. When should you use logistic regression instead of linear regression?

 Use logistic regression when the target variable is categorical, especially binary (e.g. 0/1, yes/no)
Linear regression isn’t suitable for predicting probabilities or class labels.

Ques 3. What is the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression?
Answer- Each coefficient represents the change in log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in the predictor, keeping others constant.
A positive coefficient means the odds of the outcome increase.
A negative coefficient means the odds of the outcome decrease.

Ques 4. What is the difference between sigmoid and softmax functions?

Sigmoid maps values to a probability between 0 and 1, used in binary classification.
Softmax generalizes sigmoid for multiclass classification, converting logits into probabilities that sum to 1 across classes.

Ques 5. Why is R-squared not suitable for evaluating logistic regression models?
Answer- R² measures variance in continuous outcomes. Logistic regression predicts class probabilities, not continuous values, so metrics like accuracy,
F1-score, and AUC are more appropriate.
